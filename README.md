# Labyrinth
 
It's my project. I'll talk how the project will work below.
If you want to help me, you can write me in github or vk.
In general the labyrinth is simple play, 
but I think, it will be big project.


Well. project has two files.
First file is main.py, it is main (logical). 
If you want to start the game,
you must run this file.
Second is Data.py, it has a description rooms.
If you want to play in the game, don't open this file.

For now that's all.
